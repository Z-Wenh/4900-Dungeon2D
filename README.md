# Title: Falle Ruins
Creator: Wenhua Zhen


## Description
Fallen Ruins is a 2D top down RPG game with the aspect of being a Dungeon Crawler. You will play as a lone explorer venturing deep into the ruins in search of treasure and return to the surface with fame. But be aware, treasures are not so easily earned. You must prevail against the monsters down in the ruins. The deeper you go, the more challenging the monsters become, but challenges also comes with their respective rewards. 

##
Game created using the Unity game enging and scripts written in C#.  
I don't plan for this game to be super extravagant since this is my first time creating a game, but I really hope I can turn this game into something I would feel proud of, and share with the public and friends.   
Although not currently set up, this game will be posted on itch.io in the future.
